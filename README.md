# Tic Tac Toe

This is a Tic Tac Toe project that I built by following the official [React tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe). It demonstrates fundamental concepts in React, such as components, state, and props, while building a classic game.

## Features
* Play a two-player game of Tic Tac Toe.
* Displays the winner or detects a draw.
* Keeps a history of moves, allowing users to navigate back to any previous state.
* Built with modern React features

### Thanks to React team for providing such a nice tutorial.
### Deployment to github pages
```
npm run deploy -- -m "Deploy React app to GitHub Pages"
```
P.S
Still improving this project
